# (Partial) code for upcoming CVPR 2016 paper

**Currently, we are just releasing code for loading and manipulating the dataset. Full code will be released shortly**

## Downloading the dataset

The dataset can be downloaded from:

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/495646/voxlets_dataset.zip

This is a 395MB zip file. You will have to change some of the paths in the code to the location you have extracted the dataset to.

## Getting started with the dataset

An example iPython notebook file loading a ground truth TSDF grid and plotting on the same axes as a depth image is given in `src/examples/Voxel_data_io_example.ipynb`

## Prerequisites

Coming soon...
